# Screenshot Habit Survey results
Recently, I created a survey that would collect data and qualitative responses that would help to better understand the screenshot habits of smartphone users. As the results show below, screenshots - like email - are something many people use, but it's a system that is a little broken. Instead of keeping this fascinating data to myself, I wanted to share with anyone else interested in fixing the minor issues that come with screenshots.
